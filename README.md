# Analyze-A-B-test-results
## Introduction:
This report analyse the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
## Objectives:
The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. This is done through 3 different ways:
* Hypothesis testing with my own documentation.
* Hypothesis testing using statsmodels library.
* regression analysis.
## Data used:
Attached the csv file used in the analysis. [ab_data.csv](https://github.com/MohabElghamry/Analyze-A-B-test-results/files/9122557/ab_data.csv)
